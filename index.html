      <div><h2>The Formative Years</h2></div>
      <br>
          <div>Brady was born in San Mateo, California, the only son and fourth child of Galynn Patricia (née Johnson) and Thomas Brady, Sr.[12] He has three older sisters, named Nancy, Julie, and Maureen.[13] He was raised Catholic. His father is of Irish descent, while his mother has Norwegian, Polish, and Swedish ancestry. Brady's great-great-grandparents on his father's side, John and Bridget Brady, were Irish refugees from the Great Famine who moved to San Francisco from Boston prior to the American Civil War. They were accompanied by Bridget's sister Ann and her husband Lawrence Meegan, the parents of the 19th Century American Major League Baseball player "Steady" Pete Meegan. Brady's great uncle, Michael Buckley Jr. was, also, the first American prisoner of war during World War II. </div><br>
    
          <div>Brady attended Junípero Serra High School in San Mateo, where he graduated in 1995; the ceremony was held at St. Mary's Cathedral.[24] He played football, basketball, and baseball in high school. He played against Bellarmine College Preparatory rival Pat Burrell in both football and baseball. Brady's football career started as the backup quarterback on the Padres junior varsity team. At first, Brady was not good enough to start on the 0–8 JV team that had not scored a touchdown all year.[25] However, when the starting quarterback went down with an injury, he ascended to the starting position. He became the varsity starter his junior year and held the position until he graduated.[26] By Brady's senior year, he struggled getting on the radar of college coaches. He created highlight tapes and sent them out to schools he would consider attending.[27] This led to strong interest from many football programs around the nation.</div><br>
